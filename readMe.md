## Language Model Limitations

Many language models, including `MarianMTModel`, have a maximum token length that they can process. This is typically around 512 tokens. If your input text exceeds this limit, you may encounter errors or need to split your text into smaller chunks to ensure proper processing.

### Handling Long Texts

To handle long texts, consider splitting your input into manageable chunks that fit within the model's token limit. For this sample translation, I ensured that the input text does not exceed the model's maximum token length.
